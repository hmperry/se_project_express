# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the What to Wear application. This is the database that supports the user interactivity of adding clothing articles and other users to be able to utilize the app. This version of the app has user authorization implemented into the various methods of the API.

## Technologies

This part of the project is explicitly the back end. I utlized Node.js with express to write the code. I also used Mongoose to see the data and Postman to test the many API requests and error possibilities.
